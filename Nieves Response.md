Nieves et al used the random forest model to predict population density globally. The Random Forest model works by creating several decision trees that weigh the different values of several covariates. The Random Forest model is an ensemble method, meaning that it combines several “weaker” decision trees - meaning decision trees that lack strong enough information in order to make stronger trees. Because the model uses machine learning, it doesn’t need input to distribute the values it determines; it self distributes based on the covariates. The model also relies on the concept of “bagging” which keeps the data that the decision tree was not grown on in order to later calculate the out of bag error and mean squared error for each tree. The multiple decision trees of the Random Forest model allow for it to define relationships between non linear entities. This also presents a weakness of the model as it makes it difficult to infer simple, linear relationships from the model.  A dasymetric population allocation visualizes the distribution of each population by using density based symbols to represent each region’s population distribution. The geospatial covariates that proved to be the most important when predicting where humans reside were: urban structures, built environment, environmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportation networks.
