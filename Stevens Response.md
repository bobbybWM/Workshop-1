The authors use the "Random Forest" technique to produce a high resolution distribution of human population. The technique estimates tree density based on covariates, and then correlates the tree density with human settlement patterns, finally arriving at a population distribution dasymetric map.

Machine Learning algorithms interpret the data they are fed on their own, they do not require continuous input from humans to interpret and adjust the data, although humans should still interpret and adjust the data. Previous statistical approaches to analyzing global events and populations required lots of analog inputs, such as phsyically compiling census data from everyone who mailed in their census form. Machine learning automates that process, allowing for the description and subsequent analysis to be not only more accurate (machine learning data is much easier to manipulate, allowing for errors to adjusted for) but also to happen faster and at a greater frequency.

Land cover, census data, networks of road and water ways, large bodies of water, protected area delineations, facility locations, and settlement data were the covariates used as predictors in the machine learning method. These covariates represent a very large data set. Disaggregating big data using machine learning in order to estimate the correlations and drivers of human population settlement is highly significant because it allows us to get a more accurate picture of parts of the world we know little about, allowing us to enhance processes like disaster relief and humanitarian aid.

Having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located allows development workers to reach everyone in LMICs. One of the key challenges with development is that people who need aid don't always get it. By having highly accurate settlement and population data, development workers can phsyically reach everyone they need to. Additionally, connecting every household on the planet allows for those households in previously unmapped areas to suddenly be able to participate in the global economy, improving their economic standing.

My area of investigation is Peru. Peru has several different types of terrains and settlement patterns, making it hard to locate each household. Having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across Planet Earth would allow Peru to develop significantly because development projects would be able to reach everyone from indigenous tribes in the jungle, to isolated villages in the Andes, to people without internet in the barrios of Lima.
