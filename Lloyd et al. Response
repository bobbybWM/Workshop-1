# Lloyd et al. Response

The methods described in the Lloyd et al. paper are a vast improvement when compared with those of a traditional census because unlike a traditional census the methods described in the paper can pinpoint people to a specific geographic area. Additiomally most of the data was sourced from satellites or other remote sensing tools, eliminating the need for the heavy survey work that is compiled in a traditional census. The base scales used by the authors to describe the data are 100m and 30 arc second resolution. 30 arc second resolution is equivalent to 1 kilometer at the equator. While traditional census would provide raw population data based strictly on administrative areas (like how many people are living in a certain house, on a certain street, in a certain town) the authors were able to tie people to physical locations. One way that this was accomplished was through mapping public transit stations such as rail stations and airports. The authors were able to conclude that those centers were often adjacent to areas with high population. The authors also identified physical features such as trees to generate a regression that estimated population in areas based on treee density. The data used was raster, or grid cell data. Raster data presents information in a series of cells, rather than vector data which is a more linear representation of data, presenting data in terms of coordinate points. A problem that the authors faced with using raster data was making sure that population was accurately distributed through the cells. The cells couldn't have uniform distribution, as don't live evenly spaced across land, but proportionate distribution was shown through various methods including the forest arc GIS software, and topography data sourced from NASA and other organizations. Because people don't live evenly across all of space, the data had to be disaggregated, or individually separated in order to display population data accurately.
