Peru has 3 administrative divisions. Because of the large size of Peru, my analysis was limited largely to the 2nd and 3rd administrative divisions, as my computer could not process the roughly 330 million gridcells required to look at Peru as a whole. Because of this, my analysis examined the Lima region of Peru. The Lima region includes Peru's capital (also named Lima) and is located on the Pacific coast in Western Peru.
