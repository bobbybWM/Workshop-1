# Population Density of Lima Peru

Bobby Brooks



This map shows population density within the districts of Lima, Peru. I had to subset the Lima region of Peru because Peru itself had too may gridcells to compute. As the map and accompanying chart show, Lima's most densely populous districts are Ca√±ete, Huaura, and Huaral. This makes sense as those districts are all on Peru's Pacific coast, and therefore have port access. The access to industry presumably explains the heavy population centers. The interior districts of the Lima region have less densely populated areas which may be explained by their lack of port access, and/or their status as suburban areas.
